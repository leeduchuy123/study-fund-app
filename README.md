# About my project
This is my project I built for myself to help me get motivated in learning Japanese.
Some days, I felt bored and unconcentrated. I couldn't study anything in that moment. And this app will help me build habits of learning Japanese.
Each time I studies (Vocab - Grammar/Reading) through pain, boredom,... I will put money into Study-Fund - each time 5K VND.
And the money of this fund will be spend for me to award myself, to by whatever I want or need.
--> Hope I can meet N3 at JLPT test in this December.
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
